[[code & report]](https://github.com/ashmitkx/SAiDL-Spring-Assignment-2022/tree/main/2.%20BNN) Implemented a **Bayesian MLP** to classify a simple XOR dataset. The model can easily be extended to work with more complex datasets. Defined **posterior and likelihood functions**, and used **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** Sampling. Specifically used the **Metropolisâ€‘Hastings** algorithm, for optimal weight sampling.
