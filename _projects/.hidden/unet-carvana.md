[[code & results]](https://github.com/ashmitkx/unet-carvana) **PyTorch implementation** of the U‑Net from the [U‑Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) paper, trained on the [Carvana Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data) from Kaggle. Improved on the model’s architecture by applying **batchnorm**, tested the effectiveness of the **copy‑crop connections**, and visualized what the **model is looking for**.
