[ongoing] Designed a **semi‐supervised Image Segmentation** and **Graph based Visual Question Answering** system for the [FloodNet challenge](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/challenge.html).\\
The Segmentation network is based on [CutMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899) and [Cross Pseudo Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01226). \\
The VQA system applies **geodesic dilation and morphological operations** on the segmentation maps. Connected component counts are per‐formed on **4‐adjacency graphs** made from the processed segmentation maps.\\
