[ongoing] Working towards an **Image Segmentation and Visual Question Answering (VQA)** system for the [FloodNet challenge](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/challenge.html), which is efficient enough to run on **computationally constrained devices** such as flood rescue drones. The VQA system is based on **4-adjacency graphs** of the segmentation maps, using connected components to count the number of flooded/non‑flooded houses and roads. The segmentation network is currently in progress, training the already efficient [GLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08917) on FloodNet’s aerial dataset.
