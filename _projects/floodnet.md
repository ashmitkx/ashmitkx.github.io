[ongoing] This project is related to the [EarthVision 2021 ‑ FloodNet Challenge](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/challenge.html), which involves Semi‑Supervised **Semantic Segmentation of aerial images of flood hit regions**, and **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** of the flood conditions based on the segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation models for such aerial datasets are **computationally intensive**. The project aims to obtain **near‑real time** high quality results on such VQA tasks, and develop a Neural Network that can run on **computationally constrained devices** such as drones.
