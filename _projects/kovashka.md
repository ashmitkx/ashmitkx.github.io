[ongoing] Advertisement media are **fundamentally different** from typical videos and images. They are more than just their content, **persuade users** to take certain actions, and often use [creative atypicalities](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/guo_hwa_kovashka_atypicality_iccv2021.pdf) to deliver their message.\\
Advertisement images from the [Kovashka Ads Dataset](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/ads) were textually verbalized. These were presented to text‐based language models like **GPT‐3.5, GPT‐4, and FLAN‐T5**, which were evaluated on Action‐Reason pair and Atypicality understanding tasks. \\
As a comparison between text and vision, **Vision‐Language models like BLIP2** were also evaluated on the advertisement images.\\
