I'm Ashmit Khandelwal, a third year undergraduate Computer Science student at [BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), interning at the **Adobe Media and Data Science Research** lab, and a member of the [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](www.saidl.in) at BITS Pilani. As a machine learning researcher, I'm broadly interested in **Deep Learning and Computer Vision research**. I have experience in implementing neural networks for tasks **such as visual question answering, semantic segmentation, and super resolution**.

I’m currently working on a research project under [Prof. Sravan Danda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5kSGWFoAAAAJ&hl=en), working towards an **Image Segmentation and Visual Question Answering (VQA)** system for the [FloodNet challenge](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/challenge.html), which is efficient enough to run on **computationally constrained devices** such as flood rescue drones.

Besides this, I'm also working with Adobe on finding correlations between and predicting **Saliency and Memorability** of short video **advertisements**. In the past, I’ve worked on Time Series forecasting, Image Segmentation, Super Resolution, and Bayesian Neural Networks.
