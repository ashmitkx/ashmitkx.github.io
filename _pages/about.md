I'm Ashmit Khandelwal, a third year undergraduate Computer Science student at [BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). I have a strong interest in Deep Learning, particularly **Computer Vision**. I aim to further my knowledge in Deep Learning concepts and research, and work on projects to implement new ideas.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving **Time Series forecasting, Image Segmentation, Super Resolution, and Bayesian Neural Networks**. Currently, I'm remotely interning at the [National Center for Polar and Ocean Research](https://www.ncpor.res.in/). My work here involves implementing Deep Learning models to **forecast Antarctic weather**, using **time-series data**. I'm also a member of the [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](www.saidl.in) at BITS Pilani.
