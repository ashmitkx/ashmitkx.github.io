I'm a researcher at Microsoft Research working with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/">Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan</a> and <a href="https://amitsharma.in/">Dr. Amit Sharma</a> on search and reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). I study how these systems can search, analyze, and verify information at scale, and methods to make their reasoning more reliable and controllable. 

My current research focuses on Deep Research (DR): a paradigm where LLM systems perform structured search over large corpora. I've worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04183">giving a definition to and evaluating DR</a>. I'm now focused on developing methods to verify these systems' claims, and steering their search processes. Looking ahead, I aim to extend my research to more active domains of information, such as automated computer use and misinformation mitigation in social media.

Previously, I finished my Undergraduate at BITS Pilani, India where I studied Computer Science and Data Science. I spent a summer at the <a href="https://adobe.mdsr.live/">Adobe MDSR lab</a>, where I worked with on predicting human behavior at scale using multimodal LLMs. This research was a <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=TrKq4Wlwcz">spotlight publication at ICLR 2024</a>.
