I'm Ashmit Khandelwal, final year Computer Science student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), Machine Learning Research Intern at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/), Research Assistant at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), and core member at [SAiDL](www.saidl.in). I'm broadly interested in Vision, Language, and the relation between these media and their consumers.

### My research experiance spans working with:

**My recent research work** - "[Large Content And Behavior Models To Understand, Simulate, And Optimize Content And Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00359)", done in collaboration with Adobe Research, has been accepted as a Spotlight paper at the *International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024*. 

**I've worked on** simulating human behavior using large language models, integrating vision in language models, semi-supervised segmentation, neural network pruning, Bayesian networks, and mass data scraping and processing.
